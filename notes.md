Basic Types
TypeScript = Strongly Typed Languages - Demand the specification of types.
JavaScript = Loosly Typed Languages - Do not require type specification

A language that is strongly typed can be either statically OR dynamically typed!

TypeScript is a statically typed language. This means that types are checked at compile time.
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that types are checked at run time.

Benefits include:
- Self-documenting
- Catch error in dev!
- Great for teams

Type Assertion / Type Casting - Have to be careful
